## Requirements
Required packges are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
We provide extracted features and corresponsing annotations for THUMOS14 ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SuyUdug6bb5HG0rnpDkdyIVdVp119LcV) or [Baidu Wangpan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Il8GiqdXpDRbK4W4T28tsQ) (pwd: pvfj))
and ActivityNet1.2 ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zwdF72z_y5TWAAHyZyMVcU6Bz_KFv5oL) or [Baidu Wangpan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1chPVJXffelDJ9h4WSi5riQ) (pwd: zhqy)). 

Before running the code, please download the target dataset and unzip it under `data/`.

## Running
You can train your own model by running:
```bash
python train_all.py
```
Note that you can configure the hyperparameters in `/lib/core/config.py`.

To test your model, you shall first go to the file `/lib/core/config.py` and change the entries `config.TEST.STATE_DICT_RGB` and `config.TEST.STATE_DICT_FLOW`,
then run:
```bash
python test.py
```
